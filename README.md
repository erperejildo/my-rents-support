My Rents - support page
====================

The intention of this website is to help users to understand how to use My Rents and help with any problems.

## Info

My Rents is an app to manage easily our investments, creating different portfolios to separate our rents and have a better understanding about our profit and expenses.

There is a free version available for everyone and 2 more professional ones for investors and/or business.

To start using My Rents create your account and start adding some rents into your first portfolio. You can add more information inside of them like tenant details, rent, events, etc.
